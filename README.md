Event Calendar
====================

Time to create another CRUD app. This time, we're going to make a basic list
of events, to keep track of your busy social schedule.

Unlike the TODO challenge, this challenge won't provide you with the test stubs
for your implementation. The goal here is for you to start to remember each of
the actions for your controller on your own. Try creating as much of the app as
you can from memory, using tests to guide your implementation.

Once you've completed the app (or when you get totally stuck), take a look back
at the previous challenge and see if you hit all the requirements for a CRUD
controller and implement any that are missing.

### Release 0: Getting Ready

As with the previous challenge, he model and migration for this activity have
already been created for you.  Our model is fairly similar to the last time: we
have a title and a description, but this time we also have a starting and
ending date and time. If you're using Chrome as your browser, try using an HTML
`datetime-local` input for this field to make your life a little easier.

### Release 1-N: Complete the CRUD App

You're on your own for the rest of this exercise! Hopefully creating sinatra
routes is starting to get more familiar, but don't worry if it's still all a
blur. Over time, this process will become second nature.

Good luck!
